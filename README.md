woof woof woof

my name is Frank-zilla

I am the banana man

# Bring me midgnight the endless dark,

# Bring me beasts that howl and bark,

# Bring me crimson, liquid red,

# Bring me the sickness terror bred,

# Bring me thunder, lightning true,

# Bring me hope of nothing new,

# Rot Decay, Dilapidation,

# Bring the end of anticipation
